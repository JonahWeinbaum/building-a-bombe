In the previous chapters, we have seen complicated manual cryptographic techniques give rise to a set of electromechanical tools meant to make such work tractable over short time periods. Changes to the Enigma protocol would soon necessitate the construction of one of the largest such electromechanical devices to date, known as the {\bf{Bombe}}.

\subsection{Changes to the Enigma Protocol}
Recall that during the use of the Polish Bomba, operators were instructed to send their window setting (\emph{Grundstellung}) in plaintext, and then use this to doubly encode their message key (\emph{Spruchschl端ssel}). Starting in 1940, a small but impactful change was made to the Enigma encryption protocol -- operators were instructed to send their encoded message key only once.
\\\\The Polish Bomba relied on relationships between the doubly encoded message key to function, without such relationships all the previously mentioned tools became useless. World War II had begun and the need for intelligence material was greater than ever. Thus, British intelligence brought a group of crypt-analysts, mathematicians, historians, linguists, and more, to Bletchley Park to engage in a large-scale attempt to break the Enigma machine with this new protocol.
\\\\No name is more well known from this operation than that of Alan Turing, whose work went on to become the foundations of modern computer science. Turing needed to find a new means of attacking the Enigma encryption that could no longer rely on the doubly enciphered message key. Consider that the reliance on the doubly enciphered message key was really just a reliance on the knowledge that two letters encoded the same plaintext at specific intervals of distance. Thus, Turing began engineering a method of deducing daily keys via a known plaintext attack.

% As discussed in CITE the \emph{Grundstellung} rotor
% position was sent along with the daily key and an operator chose a
% \emph{Spruchschlusse} to
% encode twice at the start of a message. Later iterations of this
% protocol removed the \emph{Grundstellung}
% from key sheets.
% \\\\These new key sheets contained the following columns
% columns \emph{Tag/Datum}, \emph{Walzenlage}, \emph{Ringstellung},
% \emph{Steckerverbindungen}, and \emph{Kenngruppen}
% \\\\Notice the removal of the \emph{Grundstellung} as well as the
% addition of the \emph{Kenngruppen}. The \emph{Kenngruppen} were a set of
% four trigrams used to identify which setting was being used to encode
% a message, this is particularly useful if trying to decode a message
% using a prior day's key.
% The operator would choose a trigram from the the \emph{Kenngruppen},
% append two letters to the front of the trigram,
% and this five letter combination (known as the
% \emph{Buchstabenkenngruppe}) would preceed the message being sent. If a message
% was sent in multiple segments, multiple \emph{Buchstabenkenngruppe}
% were used to start each segment.
% \\\\When sending a message the operator was to use the following protocol
% \begin{enumerate}[I.]
% 	\item The time at which the message was sent is listed
% 	\item The number of parts which the message contained is listed
% 	\item Which message part is being sent is listed
% 	\item The length of the message part (not including
% 	      \emph{Buchstabenkenngruppe}) is listed
% 	\item A \emph{Grundstellung} rotor position is chosen and listed
% 	\item A \emph{Spruchschl端ssel} rotor position is chosen and encoded
% 	      using the \emph{Grundstellung}, this is listed
% 	\item The \emph{Buchstabenkenngruppe} is listed
% 	\item The message part encoded using the daily key and the
% 	      \emph{Spruchschl端ssel} position is listed
% \end{enumerate}
% It is clear that with this protocol, the Polish Bomba could no longer
% deduce the necessary
% details to decrypt Enigma messages. All of the permutation
% information contained in the original key distribution
% protocol was removed and a new method needed to be derived for
% infering information about the daily key.
% \section{Loops}
% The removal of the double encoded \emph{Spruchschl端ssel} does not
% mean that permutation information cannot be stored elsewhere in the message.
% For the sake of argument, let us say we knew that our encrypted
% message had plaintext encoding

% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
% circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]
%         \node (A) at (90:1.5) {$A$};

%         \node (X) at (330:1.5) {$X$};

% above] {11} (A);
%       \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{center}

% Recall
% \begin{align*}
%     E_1 &=
% P^{-1}\theta_1R_1^{-1}\theta_1^{-1}R_2^{-1}R_3^{-1}MR_3R_2\theta_1^{-1}R_1\theta_1P
%     \\E_7 &=
% P^{-1}\theta_7R_1^{-1}\theta_7^{-1}R_2^{-1}R_3^{-1}MR_3R_2\theta_7^{-1}R_1\theta_7P
%     \\E_{11} &=
% P^{-1}\theta_{11}R_1^{-1}\theta_{11}^{-1}R_2^{-1}R_3^{-1}MR_3R_2\theta_{11}^{-1}R_1\theta_{11}P
% \end{align*}
% Then it follows that our loop can be represented by
% \begin{align*}
%     \sigma &= E_{11}\circ E_7 \circ E_{1}
% \end{align*}
% and we see that all the intermediate plugboard settings cancel out.
% Lets isolate the plugboard settings by letting
% $\overline{\sigma}$ represent $\sigma$ without the use of the
% plugboard for input and output, then
% \[
%     \sigma = P^{-1}\overline{\sigma}P
% \]
% We have that
% \begin{align*}
%     \sigma(A) &= A
%     \\\iff (P^{-1}\overline{\sigma}P)(A) &= A
%     \\\iff \overline{\sigma}(P(A)) &= P(A)
% \end{align*}

% Suppose that our initial rotor position was correct, then certainly
% our $\overline{\sigma}$ is correct. We can make a hypothesis
% that $A$ is steckered to $K$ in the plugboard. Suppose we find that
% $\overline{\sigma}(K) \ne K$, then $\sigma(A)\ne A$ and our loop is
% broken, breaking our assumptions, thus $A$ must not be steckered to $K$.
% But this will actually elimiate more hypotheses than just $A$ being
% steckered to $K$. We know that $\overline{\sigma}(K)$ is some
% letter which is not $K$. So we continue with a new hypothesis that
% $A$ is steckered to
% $\overline{\sigma}(K)$ and if we find
% $\overline{\sigma}(\overline{\sigma}(K)) \ne \overline{\sigma}(K)$,
% then we have further eliminated this possibility.
% Each new hypothesis suggests that $A$ is steckered to
% $\overline{\sigma}^{i}(K)$ which will be shown to be false if
% $\overline{\sigma}^{i+1}(K) \ne \overline{\sigma}^{i}(K)$. What if
% we find that
% $\overline{\sigma}^{i+1}(K) = \overline{\sigma}^i(K)$ at some
% point? This cannot happen since
% \begin{center}
%         \begin{align*}
%             &\overline{\sigma}^{i+1}(K) = \overline{\sigma}^i(K)
%             \\\Rightarrow \text{
% }&\overline{\sigma}^{-i}\circ\overline{\sigma}^{i+1}(K) =
% \overline\sigma^{-i}\circ\overline{\sigma}^i(K)
%             \\\Rightarrow \text{ }&\overline{\sigma}(K) = K
%         \end{align*}
% \end{center}
% which by supposition is false. Then we can continue in our
% hypotheses until we eventually reach a cycle where $\overline\sigma^i(K) = K$.
% Then we gather a set of impossible steckerings, that is
% \begin{align*}
%     P(A) \notin \{\text{ }\overline{\sigma}^i(K)\text{ }\vert\text{
% }i\in\mathbb{N}\}
% \end{align*}
% \\\\The notation we are using can be simplified significantly. The
% set $\{\text{ }\overline{\sigma}^i(K)\text{ }\vert\text{
% }i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is equivalent to the orbit of $K$ via the group
% action of the
% cyclic subgroup $\langle\overline{\sigma}\rangle$ which can be
% denoted $\langle\overline{\sigma}\rangle\cdot K$.
% \\\\We then have several cases
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item If $|\langle\overline{\sigma}\rangle\cdot K| = 26$, then
% $A$ cannot be steckered to anything which is clearly
%     impossible, thus our rotor position must be incorrect.
%     \item If $|\langle\overline{\sigma}\rangle\cdot K| = 25$, then
% $A$ can only be steckered to the remaining letter \\$\{A,\dots,Z\} -
%     \langle \overline{\sigma} \rangle\cdot K$
%     \item If $|\langle\overline{\sigma}\rangle\cdot K| = 1$, in
% this case we must have intially had $\overline{\sigma}(K) = K$ so we have not
%     eliminated any possibilities.
% \end{enumerate}

\section{Plaintext Attack}

Suppose we knew the plain-text which had been enciphered into a
particular Enigma transmission.
Consider the following mapping,
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
					circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]

		% Centering the diagram
		\node (a1) [] {\texttt{D}};
		\node (a2) [right=0.1cm of a1] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a3) [right=0.1cm of a2] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a4) [right=0.1cm of a3] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a5) [right=0.1cm of a4] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a6) [right=0.1cm of a5] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a7) [right=0.1cm of a6] {\texttt{X }};
		\node (a8) [right=0.1cm of a7] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a9) [right=0.1cm of a8] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a10) [right=0.1cm of a9] {\texttt{Y}};
		\node (a11) [right=0.1cm of a10] {\texttt{X}};

		% Nodes for ciphertext
		\node (x1) [below=1cm of a1] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (x2) [below=1cm of a2] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (x3) [below=1cm of a3] {\texttt{R}};
		\node (x4) [below=1cm of a4] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (x5) [below=1cm of a5] {\texttt{C}};
		\node (x6) [below=1cm of a6] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (x7) [below=1cm of a7] {\texttt{D}};
		\node (x8) [below=1cm of a8] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (x9) [below=1cm of a9] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (x10) [below=1cm of a10] {\texttt{R}};
		\node (x11) [below=1cm of a11] {\texttt{A}};

		% Arrows for mapping
		\draw[->] (a1) -- (x1) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {1};
		\draw[->] (a2) -- (x2) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {2};
		\draw[->] (a3) -- (x3) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {3};

		\draw[->] (a8) -- (x8) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {8};
		\draw[->] (a9) -- (x9) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {9};
		\draw[->] (a10) -- (x10) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {10};
		\draw[->] (a11) -- (x11) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {11};

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where the top row indicates our enciphered message, the bottom row
indicates the plain-text,
and the indices on the arrows indicate how many steps forward our
Enigma machine has moved while enciphering this message.
\\\\From this pairing we have that
\begin{center}
	$\sigma_1(\texttt{A}) = {\texttt{D}}$\\
	$\sigma_7(\texttt{D}) = {\texttt{X}}$\\
	$\sigma_{11}(\texttt{X}) = {\texttt{A}}$\\
\end{center}
% Our goal is to determine which Enigma settings were used to encipher
% the message.  In order to achieve this,
% we will examine which settings maintain the relationships between the
% enciphered and plaintext letters.
% \\\\For example, any setting which maintains the above pairing must
% encipher $\texttt{A}$ to $\texttt{D}$ from the first position of the machine, then at
% the seventh position, it must encipher $\texttt{D}$ to $\texttt{X}$, and at the
% eleventh position $\texttt{X}$ must be enciphered back to $\texttt{A}$. It follows that if we had
% three Enigma machines connected in series, with an offset of 1, 7,
% and 11, from our initial position, then inputting $\texttt{A}$ on the first
% machine would result in an ouput of $\texttt{A}$ on the
% third machine.
Thus, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_7$, and $\sigma_11$ form a loop starting at \texttt{A}. We visualize this loop as follows
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
					circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]
		\node (A) at (90:1.5) {$\texttt{A}$};
		\node (D) at (210:1.5) {$\texttt{D}$};
		\node (X) at (330:1.5) {$\texttt{X}$};

		\draw[<->, bend right=45] (A) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {1} (D);
		\draw[<->, bend right=45] (D) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {7} (X);
		\draw[<->, bend right=45] (X) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {11} (A);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Recall that, ignoring turnover, each $\sigma_i$ is of the form
\begin{center}
	$\sigma_i = S^{-1}P^{-(x+i)}N^{-1}P^{x+i}M^{-1}L^{-1}RLMP^{-(x+i)}NP^{x+i}S$
\end{center}
We will denote $\sigma_i$ separated from its plugboard as
\begin{center}
	$\overline{\sigma_i} = P^{-(x+i)}N^{-1}P^{x+i}M^{-1}L^{-1}RLMP^{-(x+i)}NP^{x+i}$
\end{center}
\noindent that is $\sigma_i = S^{-1}\overline{\sigma_i}S$
(conversely, $\overline\sigma_i = S^{-1}\sigma_iS$)\footnote{It should be noted that $S$ = $S^{-1}$ since the plugboard is always an involution}.
Then our loop is expressed by the fact that
$\sigma_{11}\sigma_7\sigma_1$ has a fixed point at $\texttt{A}$.
We also note that the intermediate plugboard settings cancel out, that is
\begin{center}
	\begin{align*}
		\sigma_{1}\sigma_7\sigma_{11} & =
		S^{-1}\overline{\sigma_{1}}SS^{-1}\overline{\sigma_7}SS^{-1}\overline{\sigma_{11}}S
		\\&= S^{-1}
		\overline{\sigma_{1}}\overline{\sigma_7}\overline{\sigma_{11}}
		S
	\end{align*}
\end{center}
We will condense this notation by defining
\begin{center}
	$\pi \coloneq \sigma_{1}\sigma_7\sigma_{11}$
\end{center}
and
\begin{center}
	$\overline{\pi} \coloneq
		\overline{\sigma_{1}}\overline{\sigma_7}\overline{\sigma_{11}}$
\end{center}
And thus we have shown $\pi = S^{-1}\overline{\pi}S$ (conversely,
$\overline\pi = S^{-1}\pi S$).
\\\\Let us hypothesize that $\texttt{A}$ is steckered in the plugboard to
$\alpha$ -- that is, $S(\texttt{A}) = \alpha$ (conversely, $S(\alpha) = \texttt{A}$).
It then follows that for a fixed $i\in\mathbb{N}$
\begin{center}
	\begin{align*}
		\overline{\pi}^i(\alpha) & = S\pi^i S(\alpha)
		\\&= S \pi^i(\texttt{A})
		\\&= S(\texttt{A})
	\end{align*}
\end{center}
and so we derive
\begin{center}
	$S(\texttt{A}) = \alpha \Rightarrow S(\texttt{A}) = \overline{\pi}^i(\alpha)\text{
		}\forall\text{ }i\in\mathbb{N}$
\end{center}
Then we have that $\texttt{A}$ must be steckered to all values in the set
$\{\overline{\pi}^i(\alpha)\text{ }\vert\text{ }i\in\mathbb{N}\}$.
We note that this set is that orbit of the element $\alpha$ under the
group action of the subgroup $\langle\overline{\pi}\rangle$ -- that is,
$\langle\overline{\pi}\rangle\cdot\alpha$.
\\\\By construction of the Enigma machine, $\texttt{A}$ cannot be steckered to
more than one value at a time, so if
$|\langle\overline{\pi}\rangle\cdot\alpha| > 1$ our initial
hypotheses that $S(\texttt{A}) = \alpha$ must have been incorrect. Further,
the above argument also illustrates that $\texttt{A}$ cannot be steckered to
any element in the orbit of $\alpha$ since
we would similarly find that the orbit of \emph{that} element was not a
singleton. Then we now have
\begin{center}
	$|\langle\overline{\pi}\rangle\cdot\alpha| > 1 \Rightarrow \texttt{A} \text{ cannot be steckered to any element in }\langle\overline{\pi}\rangle\cdot\alpha$
\end{center}
thus eliminating several elements that $\texttt{A}$ could be steckered to.
\\\\By representing $\overline\pi$ in its cycle notation we can
quickly see whether certain hypotheses are possible. For example,
suppose we found that
\begin{center}
	$\overline\pi = (\texttt{ABCDEF})(\texttt{GHIJK})(\texttt{L})(\texttt{MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ})$
\end{center}
If we suppose that $\texttt{A}$ is steckered to any element in the cycle
$(ABCDEF)$ we find that this
element has an orbit of length $6$ in $\langle\overline\pi\rangle$
and thus $\texttt{A}$ cannot be steckered
to any element in this cycle. Then it is clear that $\texttt{A}$ can only be
steckered to $\texttt{L}$ in this case.

\subsection{Scanning Methods}
Turing describes various methods of mechanizing the above analysis of
cycle-type to determine when we can eliminate rotor positions.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If we examine a particular hypothesis, say $\texttt{A}$ is steckered
	      to $\texttt{A}$, we can rule out this steckering if we find that $\texttt{A}$ is
	      not in a $1$-cycle, that is if $\overline\pi(\texttt{K}) \ne \texttt{K}$. If we
	      mechanize this process we can eliminate rotor positions which do
	      not satisfy this singular hypothesis. Turing called this method
	      \textbf{single line scanning}. Note, however, that this method
	      may eliminate rotor
	      positions which do have valid steckerings, just not the
	      particular steckering that we hypothesized.
	\item If we perform single line scanning in sequence, that is, for
	      each steckering hypothesis, we can rule out rotor positions which
	      have all steckering hypotheses invalid. Turing called this method
	      \textbf{serial scanning}.
	\item Serial scanning requires a separate examination of each
	      steckering. Turing proposed a machine which could concurrently
	      examine all steckering possibilities and eliminate rotor positions
	      which had no valid steckerings. Turing called this method
	      \textbf{simultaneous scanning}.
	\item If we find $\overline\pi$ has a $26$-cycle, then we must
	      have that there are no $1$-cycles and thus no valid steckerings.
	      It then follows that the rotor position is incorrect.
	      If we mechanism this process we can eliminate \emph{some} rotor
	      positions which do not have valid steckerings. We will call this
	      method \textbf{spider scanning}. Note, however, that this method
	      would not, for example, detect that $\overline\pi$ with cycle type $2^{13}$ contains no
	      valid steckerings. As Turing explained,
	      \say{The ideal machine that Welchman was aiming at was to reject
		      any position in which a certain fixed-for-the-time Stecker
		      hypothesis led to any direct contradiction... The spider does
		      more than this in one way and
		      less in another. It is not restricted to dealing with one Stecker
		      hypothesis at a time, and it does not find all direct
		      contradictions.} Effectively, spider-scanning is like a form of
	      simultaneous scanning which is restricted
	      to examining only one cycle at a time.
\end{enumerate}
Iterations of each scanning methods were proposed or designed, but in
the end we find that the spider scanning method was used in the
implementation of the Bombe. At a high level, we encode the structure
of the plaintext-ciphertext pairings, we input a hypothesis that a particular
letter (e.g $\texttt{A}$) is steckered to another (e.g. $\alpha$), and we
electrically produce the elements that must also be steckered to our test letter
(e.g. $\langle\overline{\pi}\rangle\cdot\alpha$) if our hypothesis
were to be true. If we find that this production generates a set of
all letters and thus disqualifies this rotor position from producing
the plaintext we observed, then we can continue on to the next rotor
position until we have no contradictory results from our hypothesis.

\section{The Bombe}

In the section, we outline the construction of a rudementary Bombe.
Our goal is to construct a machine using the above insight to quickly
elimate a rotor position based on contradictory hypotheses. We must shift from the above mathematical construction to an
% electromechanical one. We imagine the Enigma machine as black-box that takes in cables encoding, via current, each of the 4 letters, and outputs
% currents on the corresponding letter after applying the Enigma permutation.
Imagine the following set of wires encoding a possible Enigma
permutation we will denoted $\overline\pi_i$ (the bar
indicates we are not yet considering the plugboard). Further we will consider such Enigma permutations as being derived from rotors with an assumed ring setting of \texttt{ZZZ} and that the window setting at the beginning of our plaintext-ciphertext pairing is also \texttt{ZZZ}.

A couple quick notes about this abstraction. First as these lines are
simply wires, current can flow in either direction, left-to-right, or
right-to-left.
Second, we can apply current to multiple wires concurrently, for
example, applying current at $\texttt{a}$ and $\texttt{c}$ will cause $\texttt{d}$ and $\texttt{b}$ to be
live on the other side of the machine.
Finally, the choice to use lower case letters will become clear
further in this section as we want to separate the plugboard letters
from the actual plaintext-ciphertext letters.
\\\\As described in our motivating example, we may want to connect
Engima permutations in series to capture an underlying relationship
between a plaintext-ciphertext pairing.
Suppose we had plaintext-ciphertext pairing
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
					circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]

		% Centering the diagram
		\node (a1) [] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (a2) [right=0.1cm of a1] {\texttt{C}};
		\node (a3) [right=0.1cm of a2] {\texttt{A}};

		% Nodes for ciphertext
		\node (x1) [below=1cm of a1] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (x2) [below=1cm of a2] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (x3) [below=1cm of a3] {\texttt{C}};

		% Arrows for mapping
		\draw[->] (a1) -- (x1) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {1};
		\draw[->] (a2) -- (x2) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {2};
		\draw[->] (a3) -- (x3) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {3};

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\noindent Then we find that there exists a loop in the pairing as follows

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
					circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]
		\node (A) at (90:1.5) {\texttt{A}};
		\node (B) at (210:1.5) {\texttt{B}};
		\node (C) at (330:1.5) {\texttt{C}};

		\draw[<->, bend right=45] (A) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {1} (B);
		\draw[<->, bend right=45] (B) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {2} (C);
		\draw[<->, bend right=45] (C) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {3} (A);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We can then think of this loop as a series of Enigma permutations

\end{center}
As before, let us make a hypothesis regarding steckering. Suppose
$S(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{D}$. We know that $\texttt{A}$ must map to $\texttt{A}$ via
$S^{-1}\overline\pi_3\overline\pi_2\overline\pi_1 S$. In our
diagram, however we do not see a plugboard so how can we represent
the plugboard's involvement? In order
to achieve this \emph{we} will function as the plugboard by applying
voltage to the $\texttt{d}$ line on the $\texttt{A}$ cable thus implicitly performing the
plugboard mapping in which $S(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{D}$.
Then this will go through the electrical mapping $\overline\pi_1$
arriving on the \texttt{B} cable, followed by $\overline\pi_2$ arriving
on the \texttt{C} cable, followed by $\overline\pi_3$ arriving back on
the \texttt{A} cable, where \emph{we} as the implicit plugboard know that
the output of this electrical mapping must go through the plugboard
again to get a final output of \texttt{A}.
\\\\We will denote each wire by a capital and lowercase letter which
indicates both the cable and specific wire to which we refer. For
instance, line \texttt{d} on cable \texttt{A} will be denoted $\texttt{Ad}$. Any time a wire
$\texttt{Xy}$ is live, implicitly this means that there is an intermediary
plugboard which mapped $S(\texttt{X}) = \texttt{Y}$ or $S(\texttt{Y}) = \texttt{X}$.
To see this electrical mapping occur let us visualize a current being
sent through $\texttt{Ad}$.

\noindent Following our hypothesis that $S(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{D}$ we find that after sending
current through $\texttt{Ad}$ we arrive after mapping through
$\overline\pi$ back at $\texttt{Ad}$. Since we got an output of $\texttt{D}$ before the plugboard mapping, and we know that at the end this will ultimately map back through the plugboard to $\texttt{A}$ in order preserve our fixed point at $\texttt{A}$, we get the statement that $S(\texttt{D}) = \texttt{A}$ which is perfectly consistent with our original hypothesis.
\\\\On the other hand, if we change
$\overline\pi$ and repeat this process which may end up in the
following situation

\end{figure}
\noindent In this example, following our steckering hypothesis $S(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{D}$,
results in \texttt{Aa} becoming live after mapping through $\overline\pi$ and
thus we must have $S(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{A}$ as well in order for this to ultimately
map back to \texttt{A} and preserve our fixed point at \texttt{A}. This creates an inconsistency between our hypothesis and deduction meaning that we can eliminate the steckering possibilities both steckering possibilities so that $S(\texttt{A}) \notin \{\texttt{A}, \texttt{D}\}$
\\\\Effectively, this process is a mechanization of
finding the cycle containing a particular letter. In the above
figure~\ref{fig:incorrect_stecker} sending current from \texttt{Ad} until we arrive back at \texttt{Ad} is
akin to repeatedly applying $\overline\pi$ to \texttt{D}
until we return to \texttt{D}. This can be visualized in our diagram as

Where we find that in $\overline\pi$ we have the cycle $(\texttt{AD})$
since \texttt{Ad} and \texttt{Aa} are the only two live
wires in the \texttt{A} cable after allowing currently to reach a
steady-state. If we had instead applied current to \texttt{Ab} we would find
that \texttt{Ab} and \texttt{Ac} become live and give us the full
permutation $\overline\pi = (\texttt{AD})(\texttt{BC})$. The beauty of this design
is that it is able to deduce the elements in a cycle of
$\overline\pi$ nearly instantaneously since it only requires the
circuit to reach
a steady-state.
\\\\Equipped with this tool spider-scanning becomes quite trivial.
The goal of spider-scanning is to eliminate a rotor position by
checking if the permutation has a $26$-cycle. In our diagram, with four lines,
this would be analogous to testing a steckering hypothesis (any
hypothesis) and finding that the entire cable becomes live. Then all
elements lie within the same cycle of $\overline\pi$ and thus all
steckering possibilities are immediately eliminated.
\\\\We can also near instantaneously determine which arrangements to
eliminate with spider-scanning. When an arrangement is such that it
cannot be eliminated and further examination is needed, we will cause
the machine to stop.
\subsection{Stopping Mechanism}
To see how this is done, we will illustrate how we can detect
when a line say \texttt{Ab} is no longer live. We can place a differential
relay such that it only engages when a current difference is present
between \texttt{Ab} and some constant power supply line. Then, when current stops
flowing through \texttt{Ab}, the relay will trigger. We can then wire the
stopping mechanism to the contact terminal of the relay such that the
stopping mechanism will only trigger when line \texttt{Ab} is not live (i.e.
the relay is closed).
\\\\We can further extend this to detect when any line on the \texttt{A}
cable is not live by having each line \texttt{Aa}, \texttt{Ab}, \texttt{Ac}, \texttt{Ad} wired in
parallel, each to a separate relay, all comparing against the same
constant supply voltage. If we wire our stopping mechanism to engage
if any relay closes
then our stopping mechanism will engage if any wire ceases to be live.
\\\\This begs the question of where to place this detecting circuit.
If we are in the situation described above, a loop of Enigma
permutations, then this choice does not matter. This is because if a
$26$-cycle is present in
$\overline\pi_3\overline\pi_2\overline\pi_1$, it must also
be present in
$\overline\pi_2\overline\pi_1\overline\pi_3$ and
$\overline\pi_1\overline\pi_2\overline\pi_1$. This is
because all of these permutations are conjugates of one another, for
example we have
\begin{center}
	$\overline\pi_2\overline\pi_1\overline\pi_3 =
		\overline\pi_3^{-1}(\overline\pi_3\overline\pi_2\overline\pi_1)\overline\pi_3$
\end{center}
Since permutations in the same conjugacy class must have the same
cycle type, it follows that no matter where in the loop we place our
detector, if all wires become live on one cable they will become live on all cables. Thus, we can place our detector anywhere.

\subsection{Multiple Plaintext-Ciphertext Pairings}
In its full form the Bombe was constructed with three rows each equipped with 12 Enigma rotors\footnote{Special rotors were designed for the Bombe called {\bf{Letchworth scramblers}} that allowed for rotors to send input and outputs on the same side. }. Each row could encode a seperate plaintext-pairing simultaneously thus increasing the number of electrical connections resulting in a higher likelihood that all wires become live and thus fewer detected stops.

\subsection{Multiple Loops}
In our example we provided only a single loop encoded in the plaintext-ciphertext pairing. In practice, multiple loops could exist within such a pairing and we can electrically connect all loops together within a row on the Bombe to produce a single circuit. For instance we might have a plaintext-ciphertext pairing as follows
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
					circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]

		% Centering the diagram
		\node (a1) [] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (a2) [right=0.1cm of a1] {\texttt{C}};
		\node (a3) [right=0.1cm of a2] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (a4) [right=0.1cm of a3] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (a5) [right=0.1cm of a4] {\texttt{C}};
		\node (a6) [right=0.1cm of a5] {\texttt{C}};

		% Nodes for ciphertext
		\node (x1) [below=1cm of a1] {\texttt{A}};
		\node (x2) [below=1cm of a2] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (x3) [below=1cm of a3] {\texttt{C}};
		\node (x4) [below=1cm of a4] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (x5) [below=1cm of a5] {\texttt{B}};
		\node (x6) [below=1cm of a6] {\texttt{A}};

		% Arrows for mapping
		\draw[->] (a1) -- (x1) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {1};
		\draw[->] (a2) -- (x2) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {2};
		\draw[->] (a3) -- (x3) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {3};
		\draw[->] (a4) -- (x4) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {4};
		\draw[->] (a5) -- (x5) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {5};
		\draw[->] (a6) -- (x6) node[midway, left, draw=none, fill=none] {6};

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Thus encoding the following loops
\begin{center}
	\scalebox{0.8}{
		\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, every node/.style={draw,
						circle, minimum height=0.1cm, minimum width=0.1cm}]
			\node (B) at (135:4) {\texttt{B}};
			\node (C) at (45:4) {\texttt{C}};

			\node (A) at (0,0) {\texttt{A}};
			\node (B2) at (225:4) {\texttt{B}};
			\node (C2) at (315:4) {\texttt{C}};

			\draw[<->, bend right=45] (A) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {4} (B2);
			\draw[<->, bend right=70] (B2) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {5} (C2);
			\draw[<->, bend right=45] (C2) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {6} (A);
			\draw[<->, bend left=45] (A) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {1} (B);
			\draw[<->, bend left=70] (B) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {2} (C);
			\draw[<->, bend left=45] (C) to node[midway, draw=none, above] {3} (A);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	}
\end{center}

	\label{fig:multiloops}
\end{figure}
\noindent Again, this increased electrical connections resulting in fewer stops. We will return in the next chapter to the effect that multiple loops has on the number of stops.

\subsection{Indicator Drums and Ring Setting}
The Bombe is set up with a series of drums
\begin{center}
	$R_{x_1, y_1, z_1},\dots, R_{x_k, y_k, z_k}$
\end{center}
intended to encode the various positions of our Enigma machine while enciphering our plaintext-ciphertext pairing. We will assume that the initial setting while encoding the message was \texttt{ZZZ}. It will run through all $26^3$ positions of the Enigma machine until it finds a stop. Suppose that at a stop the drums have positions
\begin{center}
	$R_{a_1, b_1, c_1},\dots, R_{a_k, b_k, c_k}$.
\end{center}
Given that our supposed ring setting was \texttt{ZZZ} (we will denote (\texttt{26},
\texttt{26}, \texttt{26})), we now know that a candidate with a ring setting of (\texttt{26},
\texttt{26}, \texttt{26}) and window setting of $(a_1, b_1, c_1)$ which should produce our expected plaintext at the location of the first letter included in our loop. Of course, we want the plaintext from the beginning of our plaintext-ciphertext pairing, so this should actually occur at a window setting of
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:bombe_stop}
	(\texttt{Z} + (a_1-x_1)\text{ mod }26, \texttt{Z} + (b_1-y_1)\text{ mod }26, \texttt{Z} + (c_1-z_1)\text{ mod }26)
\end{align}
with a ring setting of (\texttt{26},
\texttt{26}, \texttt{26}). Recall, that our assumed window setting at the beginning of our plaintext-ciphertext pairing is \texttt{ZZZ}. We want to move our window setting \ref{eq:bombe_stop} to correspond with this but, in order to maintain permutation which produced the stop, we must move the ring setting backwards by the same amount we must move from \ref{eq:bombe_stop} to \texttt{ZZZ}. This displacement is given by
\begin{align*}
	((a_1-x_1)\text{ mod }26, (b_1-y_1)\text{ mod }26, (c_1-z_1)\text{ mod }26)
\end{align*}
since the \texttt{Z}s cancel out. Then we must move our assumed ring setting of (\texttt{26},
\texttt{26}, \texttt{26}) backwards by this same amount giving a ring setting of
\begin{align*}
	(\texttt{26} - (a_1-x_1)\text{ mod }26, \texttt{26} - (b_1-y_1)\text{ mod }26, \texttt{26} - (c_1-z_1)\text{ mod }26).
\end{align*}
Notice that $(a_1-x_1, b_1-y_1, c_1-z_1)$ is just the number of steps our machine has made since it started. So, to get the ring position corresponding to the start of our plaintext-ciphertext pairing we just subtract the number of steps each rotor has made from our assumed ring position (\texttt{26},\texttt{26}, \texttt{26}). Rather than doing all this math, the Bombe was equipped with an additional {\bf{indicator drum}} which began with labels \texttt{ZZZ} and for each step the machine moved \emph{forward}, it moved the indicator drum \emph{backward}. This means that when the machine stopped, the indicator drum would immediately tell us the ring setting which corresponded to our plaintext-ciphertext pairing. Then, with this ring setting, setting our machine to the window setting \texttt{ZZZ} would produce our expected plaintext-ciphertext pairing.\footnote{The actual rotors used in the Bombe scramblers were incorrect and did not match the true Enigma rotors by varying degrees of rotation depending on the rotor in question. This meant operators did not set their window settings to \texttt{ZZZ} but rather some small offset depending on which rotors were included. This meant if we used rotors (\texttt{II}, \texttt{V}, \texttt{III}) our window setting would be \texttt{YWY}}.

\subsection{Recovering the Plugboard}
We now have a ring setting and window setting pair that should produce our plaintext-ciphertext pair, though, we have yet to deduce the plugboard setting. However, the genius of the Bombe is that much of the deduction required to workout the plugboard setting has been done for us. Consider a possible stop of the Bombe

\end{center}
Our hypothesized plugboard setting was that \texttt{A} was steckered to \texttt{C} and we found no logical contradictions thus producing a stop. This means that at a minimum we recover that $S(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{C}$. However, we may as well have hypothesis that \texttt{B} was steckered to \texttt{D} and thus we would have applied current to wire \texttt{Bd}. Note that this wire is included in our connected component so we would have recovered the exact same stop. That is, the statement $S(\texttt{B}) = \texttt{D}$ also produced no logical contradictions. Similarly, reading off cable \texttt{C} we would recover $S(\texttt{C}) = \texttt{A}$ though we already knew this from our first hypothesis. Thus, for each cable in our loop we recover a plugboard setting consistent with our initial hypothesis (though some of these may be redundant). For a sufficiently long loop we can recover several plugboard setting just by seeing which wires are electrified on which cables.
\subsubsection{Checking Machines}
While looking at the internal wiring will, in fact, derive such plugboard settings, from an operator's perspective the Bombe only displayed which steckering our cable involved in our initial hypothesis produced. For this reason, a special device was produced called a {\bf{checking machine}} whose sole purpose was to derive these plugboard settings from a stop of the Bombe. We will consider one such derivation.
% Wren reference https://wrens.org.uk/second-world-war-codebreaker/ %
\\\\The checking machine was effectively an Enigma machine with no plugboard attachment and no rotor advancement mechanism -- effectively, the checking machine represents a fixed $\overline\sigma_i$. Suppose the operator (known as a {\bf{wren}})\footnote{Wren comes from the abbreviation WRN of the Women's Royal Navy Service. Such members became the primary operators of Bombes at Bletchley Park.} knew from the Bombe stop that our hypothesis letter \texttt{A} was steckered to \texttt{C} (i.e. $S(\texttt{A} = \texttt{C}$)). Further, from our loop the wren might know that
\[
	\sigma_1(\texttt{A}) = \texttt{B}
\]
We then have that
\begin{align*}
	S(\texttt{B}) & = S(\sigma_1(\texttt{A}))                \\
	              & = SS^{-1}\overline\sigma_1 S(\texttt{A}) \\
	              & = \overline\sigma_1(\texttt{D})
\end{align*}
Then to determine what letter is steckered to \texttt{B}, the wren only needs to set their ring settings to that given by the indicator, the window settings to that corresponding to $\sigma_1$, and input \texttt{D}. Now using this newly deduced steckering the wren can produce the steckering of the next letter in the loop until we have deduced the steckerings corresponding to each letter in our loop.

\subsubsection{Invalid Stops}
If at this stage we find that a deduced plugboard setting contradicts an earlier plugboard setting we discovered, this means that the point at which the Bombe stopped is incorrect! Recall that the Bombe stops when there are no logical contradictions gleamed from its setup and the information in the loop -- this does not mean no logical contradictions exist. Further, even if no logical contradictions existed that does not mean this is the only such setting which would be logically consistent with our plaintext (though this is certainly less likely). The use of the Bombe is thus a trial-and-error procedure. We run the machine until we find a candidate stop, then we check for possible further logical contradictions, and if such contradictions are found we continue from where we left off. Many additions we discuss later in this chapter are designed with the sole purpose of reducing the number of stops we need to check down to a tractable number.
\\\\If we find our stop has valid plugboard settings, we can recover any remaining settings is quite easily. We can attempt to decrypt our ciphertext with our window setting of \texttt{ZZZ}, our ring setting given by the indicator drum, and our plguboard settings we discovered from the stop. If we find that there are letters which do not match our expected plaintext we can deduce what plugboard settings need to be added to switch out incorrect letters with their correct plaintext letters. In this way we can recover the entirety of the plugboard settings.
\subsection{Recovering the Ring Settings}
By this point we know that for a window setting of \texttt{ZZZ}, a ring setting given by the indicator drum, and a plugboard setting deduced from the state of a stop as well as additional logical induction, we can produce the desired ciphertext-plaintext pairing. However, this does not mean the ring setting that we have is the true ring setting. We assumed that turnover did not occur during our crib so in this case we can adjust our window setting and ring setting arbitrarily (so long as we keep their relative distances the same). Of course, eventually turnover will occur, at which point the discrepancy between our ring setting and the true ring setting will become apparent.
\\\\We will first illustrate how to recover the true ring setting of the rightmost rotor. We begin by setting our Enigma as previously described and inputting the ciphertext. This should produce our expected plaintext. As we keep inputting ciphertext beyond our known plaintext we will recover additional plaintext in the message. Eventually, turnover will occur and we will begin deciphering gibberish since our ring setting is not the true ring setting. To account for this, we can move our ring setting forward by one step (which means we must also move our window setting forward by one to maintain our permutation) and we can perform the same procedure, investigating if we get gibberish. Eventually, we will have arrived at the true ring setting and our deciphering will begin producing additional plaintext.
\\\\To recover the ring setting of the other two rotors we employ the same procedure though it requires a great deal of ciphertext as turnover becomes less and less frequent as we consider the middle and leftmost rotor respectively. In doing this, we have now managed to recover all of the relevant settings of the daily key.
\subsection{Cribs and Menus}

% \begin{chapquote}{Gordon Welchman, \textit{The Hut Six Story Page 120}}
% 	The bombes were useless without a crib. If a crib could be found by
% 	the Hut 6 watch, the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the
% 	assumptions of wheel order and scrambler positions that required
% 	``further analysis'' to a managable number.
% \end{chapquote}
We began with the supposition that the
cryptographer is given a known plaintext-ciphertext pairing. Unless
the cryptographer was able to intercept
a set of communications before and after encryption this supposition
seems unrealistic. However, cryptanalysts at Bletchley park
employed two clever tricks that allowed for such pairings to be
deduced with reasonable effectiveness. First, analysts were able to
cross-reference known information to theorize likely phrases in a
message. For instance, if the weather on a particular day was windy
with a chance of rain, we would expect that the weather report (which
intellegence knew arrived from specific channels at specific times)
would likely contain phrases like ``weather'', ``wind'', or ``rain''.
The second trick used by analysts was the use of permutation theory to
eliminate locations in the ciphertext where the plaintext could not
feasibly have been enciphered.
% http://www.ellsbury.com/bombe1.htm %
\\\\Recall that one consequence of the Enigma machine being a conjugate of the reflector is that no letter can be enciphered to itself. On D-Day the weather report had the following ciphertext
\begin{center}
	\texttt{QFZWRWIVTYRESXBFOGKUHQBAISEZ}
\end{center}
Given that this was a report the weather in the Bay of Biscay, we suspect it to contain the following plaintext
\begin{center}
	\texttt{WETTERVORHERSAGEBISKAYA}
\end{center}
If we overlay our ciphertext on top of our plaintext as follows
\begin{align*}
	 & \texttt{QFZWRWIVTYRE}{\uline{\texttt{S}}}\texttt{XBFOGKUHQBAISEZ} \\
	 & \texttt{WETTERVORHER}{\uline{\texttt{S}}}\texttt{AGEBISKAYA.....}
\end{align*}
we notice that at the 13th position, the letter \texttt{S} appears in both the plaintext and the ciphertext. We know that such an encipherment is impossible and therefore the suspected plaintext cannot begin at this location. If we slide the plaintext along our ciphertext we get the following
\begin{align*}
	 & \texttt{QFZWRWIVTYRESXBFOGKUHQBAISEZ}                                                                                      \\
	 & \texttt{WETTERVORHER}{\uline{\texttt{S}}}\texttt{AGEBISKAYA.....}                                                          \\
	 & \texttt{.WETTER}{\uline{\texttt{V}}}\texttt{ORH}{\uline{\texttt{E}}}\texttt{RSAGEBISKAY}{\uline{\texttt{A}}}\texttt{....}  \\
	 & \texttt{..WETTE}{\uline{\texttt{R}}}\texttt{VORHERSAGEBISKAYA...}                                                          \\
	 & \texttt{...}{\uline{\texttt{W}}}\texttt{ETTERVORHERSA}{\uline{\texttt{G}}}\texttt{EBISK}{\uline{\texttt{A}}}\texttt{YA...} \\
	 & \texttt{....WETTERVORHERSAGEBISKAYA..}                                                                                     \\
\end{align*}
We can see that at offsets $0-3$ we have coincidences between the plaintext and the ciphertext that would make enciphering at this position impossible. Only at an offset of $4$ do we observe no coincidences. Such a potentially valid location for enciphering is known as a {\bf{crib}}. We may find many such cribs for a given transmission and suspected plaintext, but if our suspected plaintext is long the likelihood of this occurring goes down significantly so we expect to find only a few cribs.
\\\\Now equipped with our crib

		\texttt{WETTERVORHERSAGEBISKAYA} \\

	\caption{Example crib}
	\label{fig:crib}
\end{figure}
\noindent We can generate a diagramatic representation of our plaintext-ciphertext pairing called a {\bf{menu}} which will be used to wire up our Bombe. We assume the enciphering starts with window setting \texttt{ZZZ} so we will denote which window setting takes each letter to the next.

\noindent Upon looking at this menu one might ask the question of why we include conntextions like the one between \texttt{X} and \texttt{H} if they are not included in any loop? From our earlier machine description its clear that such connection will never electrify additional wires. That is, they will only permute the incoming electrified wires but never increasing the quantity of electrified wires since there is no feedback. Thus they add no additional value save for perhaps slightly more plugboard information. However, an addition to the machine made by Gordon Welchman made use of such connections and produced more electrified wires even within the loops themselves, thus reducing the total number of stops needing to be checked.
% the Eniga machine is
% a series of 13 disjoint transpositions. Mathematically, this is
% because at each stage the permutation formed by the machine is just a
% conjugate of the reflector which has a $2^{13}$ cycle-type.

\subsection{Diagonal Matrix}
Recall that a wire \texttt{Xy} becoming electrified is consistent with the deduction that $S(\texttt{X}) = \texttt{Y}$. But this deduction is equivalent to the statement $S(\texttt{Y}) = \texttt{X}$. It follows then that if we apply current to \texttt{Yx} this will be entirely consistent with our current deductions and thus there will be no new logical contradictions introduced by this additional current. That is, for any wire \texttt{Xy} we can connect it directly to \texttt{Yx} through what was called a {\bf{diagonal matrix}}. In our diagram this can be viewed as follows

% 	The idea that flashed into my mind in the School was that, by
% 	interconnecting the scramblers in a completely new way, one could
% 	increase the effectiveness of the automatic test by a very large
% 	factor. I saw that we need not depend on obtaining three closed loops.
