%This version of the thesis template has been updated for the
% February 2017 thesis guidelines provided by the School of Graduate
% and Advanced Studies by David Freund and Daryl DeFord.

%  Some good options are draft and singlespacing, for drafts, and *final*,
%for the final cut, and noheadings, for a printout without headings.
%You can also use the copyright option to add a copyright.  Note:
%final will enforce a bunch of different options, like oneside, 12pt
%and doublespacing, as well as make the margins correct.   Draft, has
%larger margins and is appropriate for twosided printing.

%%%%    IMPORTANT     %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  Because dvips doesn't know/care about the page size of the dvi file
%  its working on, and because its so important that the margins of
%  your thesis are correct you have to make sure that you are using
%  the command dvi -t letter *thesisnamehere*
%
%  If you are using a terminal this is straightforward, but if you are
%  using a tex editing program it make take a little bit of searching
%  before you figure out how to make this work.
%
%  Alternatively, you might consider compiling using pdflatex, which
%  compiles straight to a PDF and doesn't have this problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Additional Packages (add as desired)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}

%\usepackage{mkindex} %Uncomment if you would like to have an index.
% Compiling with an index takes more work than compiling without one.
% You will have to look up how to use the index package.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Formatting
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Change or add to as desired.
%  These two commands make the first enumerations look like (a)
%  And the second level like (i).
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\roman{enumii})}
%  These commands make the section headings Boldface and not all
%  caps. It also removes the chapter numbers
\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{{\sc #1}}{{\sc #1}}}
\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{{\sc \thesection\ #1}}}
%  These commands have lowercase headings with chapter numbers.
%\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{markboth{#1}{}}
%\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection\ #1}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Theorem Declarations
